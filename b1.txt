There are two types of people in this one, one who live to tell us about history and other who are busy in creatng. The one who create history are the people who set an extra ordinary example of bravry, love, leadership, secrifieses, live selflessly, show devotion for the mother land, live for a dream, live to bring an exceptional change in this world and to make it a better place for the future generation.

Today I'm going to talk about recently lunch historical movies and web series in india. Web series are creating a new era of filmography where theres is no time bond of three hours or theres no sensor board to stop or modify the content of maker and where cretors get complete freedom to share the story with every small and big details they wanna to share. It says movies and now web seires are mirror of our socity, what we are thinking, Who we are and where we will be in future. They show the thinking of our socity and how its get change by time.

So as this blog is about web series Im 


if any one asked me 
what is the best way to 
learn any new programming 
language for any navy skill any new 
javascript framework i would say just 
build some practical application that you
always wanted to build. I bet you, the 
amount of projects i have built for free or valunteer 
for people are more.


The thing is most people do not take action
thats why they can not learn so many things.

If you want to learn something
just find an idea and built something
with the skills you want to learn.

if you do not built anything with skills you have 
you will never learn it.

Like you watch the videos and you do not work 
on it, it is useless trust me.
