I had the privilege of working with Ajinkya Gadgil at Aress Software. Ajinkya is super helpful 
and energetic person with great knowledge. He is one of the first people I got to know right away in aress.
He is smart,have eager to help, a great teammate and partner, and just overall a fun person to work with.
He is not only efficient at work but also kind of person who will take responsibilities that are out of scope and complete it.

He has a wealth of experience in web development, Rest Api, Asp dot Net. His skills in Angular help alot during 
the project , which makes him an invaluable asset to any company. 
I feel lucky to have worked with Ajinkya and would love to work with him again in the
future!
